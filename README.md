# Welcome to My Lovable Project

## About This Project

Hello there! I've created this project using Lovable, and I'm excited to share it with you. This README will guide you through the features and how to get started with my code.

## How to Edit the Code

You have several options to work with my project:

### Option 1: Use Lovable
The simplest way is to visit my [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/b1115c4a-8f36-4146-9beb-a715c78543f5) and start prompting. Any changes you make through Lovable will be automatically committed to this repository.

### Option 2: Use Your Preferred IDE
If you prefer to work locally with your own development environment:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone my repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install dependencies
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server
npm run dev
```

All you need is Node.js & npm installed. I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) for easy installation.

### Option 3: Edit Files on GitHub
You can also make quick edits directly on GitHub:
- Navigate to the file you want to change
- Click the pencil icon to edit
- Make your changes and commit them

### Option 4: Use GitHub Codespaces
For a cloud-based development environment:
- Go to the main repository page
- Click the "Code" button (green)
- Select the "Codespaces" tab
- Click "New codespace"
- Edit, commit, and push your changes within the Codespace
